# Mirrored

This is a minimal example of something that remotely resembles http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1639

It has three commits:

1. lein new droid ..
2. example where a fresh build (with target/ dir removed) gives you one compilation error
(added 1 file with simple core.async loop, and core.async library.)
3. example where just changing namespace name will produce different error of the same nature
